# Decentralized Specialized Rare Plant Conservation

A blockchain-based platform for documenting, tracking, and coordinating global efforts to preserve endangered plant species through transparent record-keeping and collaborative conservation.

## Overview

This decentralized system provides a comprehensive solution for rare plant conservation, enabling botanical gardens, conservation organizations, researchers, and private cultivators to collaborate in preserving endangered plant species. By leveraging blockchain technology, the platform creates immutable records of plant specimens, growing conditions, propagation efforts, and genetic diversity to ensure the long-term survival of threatened plant species.

## Core Components

### Species Registration Contract

The species registration contract establishes a verifiable registry of endangered plant varieties and individual specimens.

- **Taxonomic Documentation**: Records scientific classification, common names, and identification characteristics
- **Conservation Status**: Tracks IUCN Red List categorization and regional protection statuses
- **Specimen Registry**: Creates digital identities for individual plants with provenance information
- **Image Repository**: Links to visual documentation for identification and verification
- **Threat Documentation**: Records specific factors endangering each species

### Growing Condition Contract

This contract documents and shares optimal cultivation requirements for successful conservation of each species.

- **Environmental Parameters**: Records temperature ranges, humidity levels, light requirements, and soil preferences
- **Seasonal Variations**: Tracks changes in care requirements throughout growth cycles
- **Geographic Origins**: Documents native habitats and microclimate conditions
- **Cultivation Challenges**: Notes common difficulties and solutions in ex-situ conservation
- **Success Metrics**: Measures growth patterns and health indicators for optimizing care

### Propagation Tracking Contract

Monitors reproduction efforts and the distribution of propagated specimens across conservation networks.

- **Propagation Methods**: Documents successful techniques (seeds, cuttings, tissue culture)
- **Success Rates**: Tracks germination percentages and establishment statistics
- **Distribution Mapping**: Records movement of propagated specimens between institutions
- **Timeline Tracking**: Monitors growth stages from propagation through maturity
- **Methodology Repository**: Shares detailed protocols for successful reproduction
- **Reintroduction Efforts**: Documents attempts to establish species in native habitats

### Genetic Diversity Contract

Ensures the maintenance of sufficient genetic variation to support species resilience and long-term viability.

- **Genetic Analysis**: Records DNA fingerprinting and diversity assessments
- **Lineage Tracking**: Maps familial relationships between specimens
- **Breeding Recommendations**: Suggests optimal pairings to maximize genetic diversity
- **Population Viability**: Calculates minimum viable population statistics
- **Seed Banking**: Coordinates preservation of genetic material in long-term storage
- **Biodiversity Metrics**: Measures progress toward genetic conservation goals

## Technical Architecture

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Solana, or other eco-friendly blockchain solutions
- **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing contracts with conservation-specific logic
- **Storage**: On-chain for critical metadata, IPFS for detailed documentation and images
- **IoT Integration**: Connection with environmental sensors for automated condition monitoring
- **Interoperability**: API integration with existing biodiversity databases (GBIF, iNaturalist)
- **Mobile Access**: Field-friendly applications for data collection in remote locations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- Truffle or Hardhat development framework
- Web3 wallet for transaction signing
- Access to blockchain network

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/plant-conservation-blockchain.git
   cd plant-conservation-blockchain
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file with your specific configuration values.

4. Compile contracts:
   ```
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

5. Deploy to network:
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network [network-name]
   ```

## Usage Examples

### For Botanists and Curators

```javascript
// Register a new endangered species
await speciesContract.registerSpecies(
  scientificName,
  commonNames,
  taxonomicData,
  conservationStatus,
  nativeRange,
  threatFactors
);

// Record optimal growing conditions
await conditionContract.documentConditions(
  speciesId,
  temperatureRange,
  humidityRange,
  lightRequirements,
  soilComposition,
  seasonalVariations
);
```

### For Propagation Specialists

```javascript
// Record propagation event
await propagationContract.recordPropagation(
  parentSpecimenId,
  propagationMethod,
  dateInitiated,
  quantityAttempted,
  protocolCID
);

// Update propagation success
await propagationContract.updatePropagationResult(
  propagationId,
  successRate,
  establishedCount,
  notesOnProcess
);
```

### For Conservation Geneticists

```javascript
// Record genetic assessment
await geneticContract.recordDiversityAnalysis(
  speciesId,
  analyzedPopulation,
  diversityMetrics,
  methodologyUsed,
  recommendationsForConservation
);

// Suggest breeding pairs
const breedingRecommendations = await geneticContract.generateBreedingPlan(
  speciesId,
  availableSpecimens,
  diversityGoals
);
```

## Benefits
